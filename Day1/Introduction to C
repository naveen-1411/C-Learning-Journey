Introduction to C Programming
🔹 What is C?
C is a general-purpose, procedural programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972 at Bell Labs. It is widely used for system programming, embedded systems, and game development.

🔹 Why Learn C?
- 🔥 Fast & Efficient – Runs close to hardware.
-🖥️ Used in OS Development – Linux, Windows, and Unix are written in C.
-🎮 Game Development – Many game engines are based on C.
-🔒 Foundation for Ethical Hacking – Helps in understanding memory and system vulnerabilities.
-⚡ Gateway to Other Languages – C concepts apply to C++, Java, and Python.

🔹 Features of C
✅ Simple & Powerful – Small core with powerful libraries.
✅ Portable – Write once, compile anywhere.
✅ Memory Management – Direct access to memory using pointers.
✅ Procedural – Uses functions to break down complex tasks.
✅ Modular Programming – Supports reusable code.

🔹 First C Program
Let’s write the classic "Hello, World!" program in C:
#include <stdio.h>  // Header file for input-output

int main() { 
    printf("Hello, World!\n");  // Print output
    return 0; 
}

🔹 Explanation:
1️⃣ #include <stdio.h> → Includes the Standard Input-Output library.
2️⃣ int main() → The starting point of any C program.
3️⃣ printf("Hello, World!\n"); → Prints output to the console.
4️⃣ return 0; → Indicates successful program execution.

🔹 Your First Task! 🚀
1️⃣ Modify the "Hello, World!" program to print:
2️⃣ Try running the modified code.
3️⃣ Let me know if you have any doubts! 😃
